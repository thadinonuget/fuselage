        <h2 id="browsing">web browsing (proxies)</h2>
        proxies are sites that allow you to access blocked websites by routing your web traffic through an external server.<br><br>
        please note that proxies can be glitchy when trying to access certain websites, and some sites, mainly social media sites like youtube and discord, will intentionally block you out if you're on a proxy. to get access to these sites, you should instead use a webview bypass exploit, found in the <a href="#tools" class="hyperlink">tools & exploits</a> section.
        <br><br>most of the proxy links here are custom-made links that are for many different proxy sites. the proxy links here are organized by the different sites they link to.

        <br><br>here's the list of all the exploits on here currently. click one to be brought to it.

        </ul>
        <h3 id="yt"><br>unblocked youtube (invidious)</h3>
        watch youtube videos with no ads and with no school restrictions.<br><br>
        this is done using a site called invidious, which is an alternate youtube frontend. you can watch any videos that are on youtube, but without any ads, tracking, or restrictions.
        
        <br><br>invidious links:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><a href="https://inv.nadeko.net" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">inv.nadeko.net</a> 🇨🇱 - best link! 🔥</li>
            <li><a href="https://invidious.f5.si" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">invidious.f5.si</a> 🇯🇵 - kinda glitchy</li>
            <li><a href="https://yewtu.be" target="_blank" class="hyperlink-dead">yewtu.be</a> 🇩🇪 - currently blocked</li>


        </ul> 
        important notes:<br>
        invidious can be unstable or glitchy sometimes, and different links can sometimes go down from time to time. you also might get "checking if you're a bot" messages. they go away after a few seconds.<br>
        you can make an account on most of these links, but it is completely seperate from your real youtube account, and your account will only work on the link you created it in.
        <br><br>if it isn't not working, please don't complain to me about it, i don't run any of the invidious servers :(
        
        
        <h3 id="ai"><br>ai tools</h3>
        these are just some ai chatbots that are unblocked. make sure to pick one that's right for what you need!
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><a href="https://chat.z.ai" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">z.ai</a> - just a regular old chatbot! 👍 make sure to turn off the auto-think button if you want faster answers.</li>
            <li><a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">microsoft copilot</a> - good for more smooth-brained people who dont care about the specific model or whatever and just want quick answers 😎</li>
            <li><a href="https://scira.ai" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">scira</a> - takes a looooooong time to generate (like i mean a literal eternity), but is great at really complex questions like programming or in-depth research 🧐</li>


        </ul> 

        <h3 id="webview"><br><br>webview bypass exploits (⚠️ advanced users only!)</h3>
        webviews are small, isolated web browsers that are embedded into apps and are completely seperate from your actual browser, meaning that extensions, such as securly, won't run there. because of this, anything in a webview is completely unblocked.*
        <span class="footnote">
            <br>*webviews do NOT bypass network-level blocks on school wifi such as fortiguard/fortinet. because of this, on your home wifi, everything will be unblocked, but on school wifi, you'll still have to deal with fortiguard that blocks a lot of sites. i'm currently trying to find a workaround for this, so please be patient.
        </span>        
        <br><br>normally, webviews within apps are confined to only be able to access a single website, but sometimes lazy (or stupid) developers forget to restrict them, and you can proceed to go on any website you'd like within the unblocked webview!
        <br><br>the main benefit of using webviews rather than proxies to access blocked sites is that since the webview acts like a normal browser, websites aren't suspicious of you in the same way they would be with proxies. many websites like youtube don't allow people on proxies to use their site, since proxies are oftentimes used by hackers to try and hack websites, meaning it's more suspicious when you're on a proxy and some websites might try to block you out.
        <br><br>⛔ note: webview exploits are complicated and are only recommended for more experienced users with atleast basic knowledge of computers n stuff. if that's not you, you should instead use proxies to access blocked sites, as they're much more simple to use. ⛔
        <br><br><br>i've currently found two different working webview exploits, and they both have pros and cons.
        <br><br>the chromesignin webview bypass is the easier of the two, however, it has limitations such as not being able to use real fullscreen mode or mouselock, which are both important if you want to do things like play first-person games and whatnot, such as with the nowgg roblox exploit found below (yes, you can use the fullscreen button, but this just fullscreens the entire thing. for example, if you use the fullscreen button while watching youtube, the video won't take up your whole screen like normal, it'll just be the regular video page but fullscreened.) some benefits of it are that since it runs inside of a tab in google chrome that can be quickly closed or tabbed away from, it can be much more discreet to have open in school.
        <br><br>the ti84calc kiosk webview bypass is a bit more complicated, and runs within a kiosk app, meaning that it will take up your whole screen, it can't be quickly closed out of, and it runs while you're logged out from the chromeos desktop. however, it has the benefit that it supports fullscreen and mouselock.



        <h3 id="cswv"><br><br>chromesignin webview bypass (⚠️ advanced users only!)</h3>
        this exploit works by opening up and then bypassing a webview inside of the google chrome signin page. for more info about webview exploits like this, see the "webview bypass exploits" section above.
        <br><br>thanks to peckishtomato and blackmun on the titaniumnetwork discord server for this specific variation of the exploit!!
        <br><br>here are the steps:
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>go to chrome://chrome-signin</li>
            <li>enter google@d11.org in the signin bar and hit enter. you'll be brought to a new page for some random school, this is normal.</li>
            <li>once again, enter google@d11.org in the new signin bar and hit enter.</li>
            <li>click on "forgot my password".</li>
            <li>it'll give you a robot verification captcha thing. do the captcha and click "next".</li>
            <li>click on the button "show additional details"</li>
            <li>click "learn more"</li>
            <li>you'll be on a miscrosoft website now. scroll allllll the way to the bottom of it where you'll find a huge list of different links. click the one called "sitemap", it's in the very bottom row.</li>
            <li>on the new page, scroll down to the "popular software and services" section. in that section, look under the subsection "services" and click on "bing".</li>
            <li>use bing to search for whatever website you would like to access, like coolmathgames or whatever.</li>
            <li>almost done!! near the top search bar, click the "tools" button and switch OFF the "open links in new tab" slider.</li>
            <li>🎉 profit!! you can now click on any of the search results and they'll open completely unblocked!</li>

        </ul> 
        at first these steps may take a few minutes, but if you get it down to a science, you can do them in under 60 seconds!<br><br>
        <br>❗some important tips and info you should know when using this exploit:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>remember that if you ever close the tab that the exploit is on, you'll have to do the steps all over again the next time you want to use it.</li>

            <li>
                there IS a way to get that dumb bar at the bottom of the screen to go away (mostly). follow these steps:
                <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>on the bing page, search "reddit".</li>
                    <li>open the first result, it should just take you to the reddit homepage.</li>
                    <li>click on the reddit searchbar as if you were trying to type in it.</li>
                    <li>spam the keybind ctrl+minus to zoom the page out super far. keep spamming it until it's zoomed out to the max.</li>
                    <li>click the back arrow in the top bar of your chrome window to go back to the bing page.</li>
                    <li>you may need to wait a few seconds, but if you did it right, the bing page should be zoomed in like normal, but the dumb bar should still be zoomed out (making it super tiny!) you can now continue to use the exploit but without the stupid bar in your way! please note that this may cause some websites to glitch. if a website is glitching, go back to reddit and do ctrl+plus to zoom back in.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>because this exploit is a bit janky, just be aware that it may glitch or stop working sometimes (although 99% of the time it works great.)</li>

        
        </ul> 





        <h3 id="tiwv"><br><br>ti84calc kiosk webview bypass (⚠️ advanced users only!)</h3>
        for whatever reason, our school district decided to put an online ti84 calculator emulator website as a kiosk app on everyone's chromebooks. not sure why, but i don't really care because all we need it for is to exploit it's webview!
        <br><br>for more info about webview exploits like this, see the "webview bypass exploits" section above.
        <br><br>i found this exploit, so don't skid it or i'll rip off your toenails<br><br>
        here's the steps!!
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>open these steps up on another device since you won't be able to look at them on your chromebook while your doing the exploit.</li>
            <li>when you're signed into your chromebook like normal, press and hold the lock button on your keyboard to lock the chromebook.</li>
            <li>near the bottom of your screen, click the "sign out" button, and wait a few seconds for the screen to pop back up.</li>
            <li>it'll probably look the same as the lockscreen, that's normal. now click on the button "apps" where the sign out button used to be.</li>
            <li>click the one labeled "TI 84 Calculator Online" and wait for it to load in.</li>
            <li>you'll be brought to the app screen, which will show the calculator emulator. scroll to the top of the page and click the text "TI 84 Calculator Online" in the top left corner. an ad might show up, just close it.</li>
            <li>now you're on the site homepage, scroll down a bit until you see their support email (support@ti84calc.com). it should just look like a link. click on it!</li>
            <li>you'll now be on the google workspace website on the gmail page. up in the top bar, click on the "sign in" button.</li>
            <li>now the following steps are almost identical to the chromesignin bypass. do these steps:</li>
            <li>enter google@d11.org in the signin bar and hit enter. you'll be brought to a new page for some random school, this is normal.</li>
            <li>once again, enter google@d11.org in the new signin bar and hit enter.</li>
            <li>click on "forgot my password".</li>
            <li>it'll give you a robot verification captcha thing. do the captcha and click "next".</li>
            <li>click on the button "show additional details"</li>
            <li>click "learn more"</li>
            <li>you'll be on a miscrosoft website now. scroll allllll the way to the bottom of it where you'll find a huge list of different links. click the one called "sitemap", it's in the very bottom row.</li>
            <li>on the new page, scroll down to the "popular software and services" section. in that section, look under the subsection "services" and click on "bing".</li>
            <li>you're now on the bing homepage. use bing to search for whatever website you would like to access, like coolmathgames or whatever.</li>
            <li>almost done!! near the top search bar, click the "tools" button and switch OFF the "open links in new tab" slider.</li>
            <li>🎉 profit!! you can now click on any of the search results and they'll open completely unblocked!</li>

        </ul> 
        at first these steps may take 5-8 minutes, but if you get it down to a science, you can do them in under 2 minutes!<br><br>
        <br>❗some important tips and info you should know when using this exploit:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>when you want to exit the webview to go back to regular chromeos, just press and hold the power button on the side of your chromebook and then click "sign out". wait a few seconds, and you'll be brought back to the lockscreen.</li>
            <li>since it's in complete fullscreen, there's no back or forward arrows or url bar to easily navigate between sites. if you need to go back to the previous site, click the physical back arrow button on your keyboard.</li>
            <li>because this exploit is a bit janky, just be aware that it may glitch or stop working sometimes (although 99% of the time it works great.)</li>

        
        </ul> 



        <h3 id="ngg"><br><br>play roblox on your chromebook through now.gg [requires use of a webview bypass!]</h3>
        how this works:<br>
        there's a website called now.gg that allows you to play roblox in your browser by running the roblox app in an android emulator on a cloud server, then streaming the audio and video from it to your browser, and streaming your touch and keyboard inputs to the cloud server. basically, it just makes a fake android phone running roblox that you can use in your browser.
        <br><br>sadly (although for very obvious reasons), nowgg is blocked on securly. however, since the webview bypasses let you access almost any blocked site, we can put two and two together and access nowgg through the webview!
        <br><br>it's a bit more complex than just going to the site and it working perfectly though, so here's all the steps to use this exploit:
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>do all the steps for one of the webview bypasses that you can find above. 
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>
                        if you want more immersive, fullscreen gaming, and want to be able to play first-person games properly, you should use the ti84calc kiosk webview bypass. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if you want a more discreet webview that's inside a chrome tab, and don't care about fullscreen or first-person, use the chromesignin webview bypass.

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>on the webview bing page, search "nowgg".</li>
            <li>open the first result, you'll be brought to the nowgg homepage.</li>
            <li>go to the searchbar and search "roblox" and click the one called "roblox" (obviously)</li>
            <li>you'll probably have to watch an ad, just wait for it to end (or click the skip button if it appears.)</li>
            <li>you will now be greeted with the roblox signin page, you're almost ready to go!</li>
            <li>to make all the dumb ads on your screen (mostly) go away, and so that the roblox window takes up more of your screen and isnt teeny tiny, follow these steps:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>click on the nowgg search bar as if you were trying to type in it.</li>
                    <li>spam the keybind ctrl+minus to zoom out until you have hit the max.</li>
                    <li>now the game window should resize to be huge, and the ads will be so tiny you can barely see them!!</li>
                    <li>note: if you're on the ti84calc bypass, you can also click the fullscreen button under the game window to make it even a bit bigger if you'd like.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>now you can sign in with your own account or just make a random alt account. i recommend just making a random alt account unless you wanna play a game where you want your old progress, since putting in your real account details has a small chance of exposing them to others and getting your account hacked.</li>
            <li>note: when you're signing in or signing up, you may get a popup saying "choose device for passkey". just click cancel when it shows up.</li>
            <li>🎉 profit!! now you can play roblox games on your chromebook! although please make sure to read the notes below, since there are some strings attached.</li>

        </ul>
        <br>❗ important tips and info you should know when using nowgg:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>you can't really play any high-performance or graphics-intensive roblox games like FPS games and whatnot, since it will most likely freeze, crash, or just lag super bad if you do. this exploit is much more well-suited for simpler, more casual games like brookhaven or grow a garden or whatever the hell it is you kids play these days. honestly i really hope you weren't expecting a triple-A, high-quality gaming experience from this janky exploit</li>
            <li>if you're using the chromesignin bypass rather than the ti84calc bypass, mouselock doesn't work. this means can't really play any game in first-person because if you move your mouse too far it will drift off the screen. you could just use the regular touch controls like on a phone, since the chromebooks do have touchscreens, but they're too slow and janky for playing any games that need fast input response-times, like competitive FPS games.</li>
            <li>you may sometimes get popups saying something like "yOu WoN a NoWbUx!!1!", these are just nowgg trying to make you give them your money, just close them</li>
            <li>sometimes nowgg is just glitchy and awful, like sometimes it will say "servers under high load" and won't let you play, or sometimes it will just crash randomly or be glitchy and weird for no reason. don't expect it to work all the time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="dns"><br><br>securly dns bypass (omadaDNS) - super easy!!</h3>
        use a custom dns server (hosted by omada) that's designed to block spyware and blocking extensions like securly from working. it also blocks ads on some websites.
        <br><br>it basically disables the securly extension, but doesn't bypass network blocks including fortiguard.
        <br><br>you CANNOT use this on the school wifi, since the LS wifi profile on all enrolled chromebooks is admin configured to use preset nameservers. this ONLY works when you're on your home wifi.
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>go to settings > network > wifi</li>
            <li>find the name of the wifi network you want to add this bypass to, and click it (remember, you CANNOT do this to the school wifi)</li>
            <li>scroll down and click "network", then scroll down to "name servers"</li>
            <li>check the box "custom name servers"</li>
            <li>set the first and second addresses to 66.23.198.252 and 66.94.105.229 (leave the rest as 0.0.0.0)</li>
            <li>optional: repeat these steps for each wifi network you would like to unblock</li>
            <li>🎉 profit!! securly should now be disabled on those wifi networks.</li>

        </ul>


        <h3 id="pwsh"><br><br>chromebook powerwash</h3>
        "powerwashing" a chromebook is when you fully wipe all of the data off it and are taken back to the original setup screen.
        <br><br>important: this will NOT get you out of the school software and restrictions such as securly. as soon as you connect to wifi and start going through setup, it will phone home to a google server and add all of the school spyware back automatically. this guide is mostly just here for if you are having issues with your chromebook and need a brute-force way to troubleshoot it. 

        <br><br>also important: this will completely wipe all of the downloaded files, browser cookies, etc, but will add back almost all of your google account stuff and settings, such as wallpaper, bookmarks, apps, etc, once you sign in with your school account.
        <br><br>also also important: do NOT do this at school, as you will not be able to connect to school wifi to re-enroll and you'll have to take it to IT to get it working. you should only do this at home where you can use your home wifi. make sure you know your home wifi password!!!
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>press the keybind esc+refresh+power to boot into chromeOS recovery mode.
                <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>this might take a few tries. if it just reboots you into regular old chromeOS, try again until you get to recovery.</li>
                    <li>make sure you're pressing the physical refresh key on your keyboard (in the top row).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>do ctrl+d to get to the devmode screen. it will probably warn you about your system being insecure, don't worry about that since you're not actually going to use devmode.</li>
            <li>hit enter to confirm, and the screen will go black for a few seconds. then, your chromebook will make a very loud and annoying beep noise, and it will tell you developer mode is not allowed ask you to "return to secure mode".</li>
            <li>return to secure mode and your screen will go black again.</li>
            <li>it should show a message like "system last booted in developer mode, returning to secure mode. upon completion system will reboot".</li>
            <li>after a while, it will show you the chromebook setup screen "welcome to chromebook".</li>
            <li>to setup and log back in, hit "get started" and follow the prompts. connect to wifi, sign back in with your school account, etc. and you should be good to go!</li>

        <h2 id="misc">miscellaneous</h2>
        these are random things that aren't really related to school or unblocking but are still fun/interesting.
        <h4>unsecured live webcams/security cameras (webcamxp/webcam7)</h4>
        there's a software called webcamxp5 (or webcam7) that allows people to hook up security cameras to their computers and view them from any device. 
        <br>however, many people who use this software are not smart enough to password-protect their webcams, so they can be viewed by anyone on the internet with a simple google search and a few minutes of free time to find them.
        <br>i would give out the method to find these webcams, but it's not the safest and can sometimes end you up on some... not good... corners of the internet (viruses, etc).
        <br><br>however, you can look at some of these webcams i've already found and documented below.
        <br><br>some of these are home security cameras, some are cameras inside of stores or offices, some are just random things like views of lakes or oceans, and some are even creepy views of dark areas. honestly, there's a bit of everything. 
        <br><br>each of these entries has a name, link, and description. see them below:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

            <li><a href="http://88.166.157.13:8085/multi.html" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">rural farm</a> - 5 different camera views of a cute little farm in the woods. sometimes you can see animals!</li>

        <h2 id="about">about</h2>
        <h4>what is riptide?</h4>
        riptide is a document that i use to share links, resources, and information about curing boredom at school. i update it at least every few days with fresh links and stuff.<br><br>
        please note that this site is mainly for people using school chromebooks, not ipads, and many resources on here that work on chromebooks will be blocked on ipads. sorry!!
        <h4>why does the link look all weird?</h4>
        the link is actually a small piece of code that executes when you open it, pulling the real website data directly from a web server (jsdelivr) in the form of a javascript file, then displays the data. using this system, it completely avoids securly's auto-blocker thing (which is supposed to scan websites for malicious content like games and automatically block them) because not only did securly's braindead developers not configure it to scan datalinks, they also whitelisted the server that hosts the content. they've reached the peak of stupidity.

        <h4>contact</h4>
        if you have suggestions, requests, a link you want me to add, or want to send me the entire bee movie script, send me an email at <a href="mailto:math.homework.algebra.100@gmail.com" class="hyperlink">math.homework.algebra.100@gmail.com</a> (totally non-suspicious alt account). i don't accept emails from school addresses, please use your home email address.
